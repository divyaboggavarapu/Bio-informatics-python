\section*{Collaboration Statement}
I have collaborated with Vijitha Kotapati (UTAID: 1001860730) and Divya Boggavarapu (UTAID: 1002086719) to work on the problems 2, 3 and 4 by understanding the concepts of Substitution Matrix, Global Alignment and Local Alignment.

\section{Substitution Matrices}

Suppose that transition mutations (A ←→ G and T ←→ C) are less common than tranversions (A ←→ T, A ←→ C, G ←→ T, and G ←→ C). The following is the substitution matrix that reflects this:
\\

\begin{matrix}
\hline
&A&G&T&C \\
\hline
A&1&-5&-1&-1\\
G&-5&1&-1&-1\\
T&-1&-1&1&-5\\
C&-1&-1&-5&1\\
\end{matrix}
\\

\section{Global Alignment}

We have conducted global alignment with the Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm and implemented it in a single python file "\textbf{1002010740\_NW.py"}
\\

The global alignment function in the file will take in
sequence A and sequence B as strings to be aligned (assume that these
strings only contain the chars “acgt” for problem 2), a gap penalty, and a
substitution matrix and returns a list of tuples representing possible
alignments.

\subsection{Example}

In \textbf{1002010740\_NW.py}, we executed the global alignment function with input strings “GATA”
and “CTAC”, substitution matrix d and gap penalty as parameters which returned the tuples ("GATA", "-CTAC"),(“GATA-”,“C-TAC”).

\section{Local Alignment}

We conducted local alignment with the Smith-Waterman algorithm and implemented it in a single python file called \textbf{"1002010740\_SW.py"}.
\\

The local\_alignment function in the file will take in
sequence A and sequence B as strings to be aligned (assume that these
strings only contain the chars “acgt” for problem 2), a gap penalty, and a
substitution matrix and returns a list of tuples representing possible
alignments.

\section{A Custom Alignment}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I have taken my first name \textbf{tulasi}, last name \textbf{navuluru} in lowercase and concatenated them to be \textbf{'tulasinavuluru'}.
  \item I have written code to create a custom substitution dict to substitute all the 26 English alphabets as characters and included code for this problem in the file \textbf{"1002010740\_CUSTOM.py"}
  
  The file \textbf{"1002010740\_S.txt"} will provide the output of my pretty matrix.
  
  \item I ran “local\_alignment” function from Problem 3 with the custom S defined by my name, a gap penalty of -2, my concatenated name (i.e. “tulasinavuluru”) as the first string, and the pangram “thequickbrown- foxjumpsoverthelazydog” as the second string. Following are the output tuples:
  \\
  \textbf{[('tulasinavuluru', 'thequickbrownf'), ('\_\_avuluru', 'thequicfoxjump'), ('\_lasinavuluru', 'thmpsoverthela')]}
  
  \item The file \textbf{"1002010740\_D.txt"} will provide the output of my pretty matrix. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Difficulty Adjustment}
Please find my answers to the questions asked as below: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item  How long did this assignment take you to complete?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{I completed my assignment in 15 hours.}
    \end{itemize}
    \item  If the assignment took you longer than the 10 hours, which parts were overly difficult?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{The assignment was challenging. I learnt new concepts like Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm, Smith-Waterman algorithm in depth while working on this assignment. }
